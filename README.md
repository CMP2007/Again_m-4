## Summary

This repository contains the fourth part of the Full Stack Open course. This section formalizes the project structure, delves deeper into the backend by implementing tests, user management, and token validation. This level was resumed after a considerable period of inactivity; therefore, it is normal to find structural differences in this repository compared to previous ones.

## My process

### What I learned

As I mentioned before, there was a fairly long period of inactivity between this level and the previous one, which made me lose track of the course. Therefore, I decided to start from scratch. I literally put aside my previous notes and exercises and restarted both the practice and the theory. This also lengthened the time between the previous level and this one, but it allowed me not only to improve my overall understanding of the previous topics, but also, I believe, to improve the quality of my work and my performance in this area.

At this level, I was able to learn and put into practice:

The "Separation of Concerns" pattern, thus improving the project's structure, its readability, and its long-term sustainability.

I separated:

- **controllers**
- **models**
- **utilities**
- **middleware**

I also implemented Async/Await for controller requests.

I implemented tests to verify the API's behavior.

And finally, I applied security principles for managing usernames and passwords.
